# 🏠 House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

Welcome to my first project in the Machine Learning space!  
This project predicts house prices using a Linear Regression model trained on synthetic data. It serves as a foundational step in my ML journey and portfolio.

---

## 📌 Overview

In this project, we use basic machine learning techniques to build a model that predicts house prices based on features like size and number of bedrooms. Though the dataset used here is generated or minimal, the focus is on understanding the ML pipeline from data preparation to model evaluation.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand and implement **Linear Regression** for regression problems
- Learn **data preprocessing**, model training, and evaluation
- Visualize data and model performance
- Build a strong foundation for future real-world deployments

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Created a synthetic dataset with features such as house size, number of bedrooms, etc.

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Explored data trends and relationships using scatter plots and histograms.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Used `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn` to fit the model on training data.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² score, and visual inspection.

5. **Prediction**  
   - Used the model to predict house prices based on test data.
